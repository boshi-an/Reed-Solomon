# Reed-Solomon

A fault tolerant transmission algorithm

Encoder : The encoder of the algorithm, running in $$O(n^2)$$ time.

Decoder : The decoder of the algorithm, using berlekamp-welch algorithm. Running in $$O(n^4)$$ time.

Functions : The basic functions used in abouve algorithms, like gaussian-elimination and polynomial division
